# downloads-wiper
Simple script that prompts to wipe files (excluding folders) in ~/Downloads and ~/Pictures/Screenshots.
This is just ensures that you'll have a clean start after every login. Add the "-r" option after rm to also delete folders.
Not recommanded tho, cuz you might lose some more imporant data.

To use it, just create an autorun entry and it should work fine.
